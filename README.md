Experimenting with browsers in github actions

### Existing Examples

The community has created a few actions which package a browser in a couple
of ways and offer various features (e.g. headless or not, locked to a specific
version or not):
  - [Puppeteer Container](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/puppeteer-container)
  - [Puppeteer Headful](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/puppeteer-headful)
  - [setup-chromedriver](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-chromedriver)
